## Complete Setup

This project will not be accepting pull requests, but you may fork the project for your own use.

- Fork or clone project
- Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies
- Run ```npm run preview```

If project does not open in a browser, there will be a link in the terminal: Ctrl + Click

To keep your forked repo up to date with any updates I make to the repo, use: 

```bash
git remote add upstream repo_url.git
```

If you find that you need to remove the upstream, use:

```bash
git remote rm upstream
```

However, I suggest checking that there is an upstream first with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## Known Bugs

- Inconsistent styling (use Tailwind and/or Styled Components)
